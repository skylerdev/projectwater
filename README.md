# projectwater
A web app that increases public awareness of wasted water in vancouver.

## Contributing

Basic style standards:

PascalCase for objects/types/classes  
camelCase for variable names  
underscored_lowercase for html file names  
lowercase for HTML ids or attributes  

HTML files should all be put in the root directory. The sources for these can be put in css and js folders.
Games can be put in /games and have their own folder.   

Libraries are no different. (bootstrap css in css along with everything else, pixi.js in same dir as game js) 

Testing standards:  

Upload changes either to deployment site or here, should use here http://hahafunnyme.me/projectwater/
